# 05 — API Route Map

> Every endpoint: method, path, auth, role gate, request/response shape.
> Auth column legend: **Any** = any authenticated user · **Editor** = admin or standard · **Admin** = admin only · **Owner** = resource owner (special-cased).
> Restricted content is **omitted from responses** for unauthorized roles (not returned-and-hidden).

**Conventions**
- All routes require a valid Logto JWT unless marked Public.
- Long-running work returns `202 Accepted` + enqueues a BullMQ job; clients poll for status.
- Errors: `{ error: { code, message } }`. Validation via zod (`packages/shared/schemas`).
- Base path for app API: `/api`. Worker exposes internal-only endpoints (not public).

## Assistant — general AI chat (Module 14) ⭐ NEW

> Replaces ChatGPT seats. **Strictly per-user private** — every route enforces
> `user_id = self`. Admins cannot read content (only purge on offboarding).
> Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-07-assistant-module-design.md`.

| POST | `/api/assistant/chats` | Any | Start a new conversation. |
| GET | `/api/assistant/chats/:id` | Any (own) | Load a conversation's messages. |

| DELETE | `/api/settings/users/:id/assistant-data` | **Admin** | Purge a user's Assistant data on deactivation. **Delete-only — never reads content.** |

**File Q&A:** extracted text is injected directly into the prompt context (no embeddings;
chunk+truncate if oversized). Attachments stay scoped to the conversation.

## API Settings — integration credentials (Admin only) ⭐ NEW

> Backs the **Admin → API Settings** page. ALL third-party API keys are editable here.
> **The raw secret is NEVER returned to the client** — only `isSet` + last-test status.
> Secrets are stored encrypted (`integration_credentials.secret_encrypted`).

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/settings/integrations` | **Admin** | List all integrations with `{ service, label, isSet, config, lastTestedAt, lastTestOk }`. **No secret values.** |
| PUT | `/api/settings/integrations/:service` | **Admin** | Set/replace a key. Body: `{ secret?, config? }`. Encrypts `secret`, sets `is_set=true`. Returns status only. |
| DELETE | `/api/settings/integrations/:service` | **Admin** | Remove stored secret (falls back to env var). |
| POST | `/api/settings/integrations/:service/test` | **Admin** | "Test Connection" — performs a lightweight live call (e.g. Recall ping, OpenAI models list). Stores `last_tested_at`/`last_test_ok`. Returns `{ ok, message }`. |

**Provider/model selection (AI-specific, also Admin):**

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/settings/ai-providers` | Admin | List configured providers + available models + which is active. |
| PATCH | `/api/settings/ai` | Admin | Set active `{ provider, model }` (writes `settings.ai_provider`/`ai_model`). Embeddings remain pinned (D9). |

**Credential resolution at runtime** (backend helper, used everywhere):
```
getCredential(service):
  1. read integration_credentials row for service
  2. if is_set → decrypt secret_encrypted → return
  3. else → return process.env[ENV_VAR_FOR(service)]   (fallback)
  4. short in-memory cache; invalidate on PUT/DELETE
```
This means a key changed in API Settings takes effect immediately, and env vars are the default until overridden.

---

## Webhooks

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/webhooks/recall` | Signature-verified | Recall.ai "transcript ready" → verify `bot_job_id` → enqueue pipeline job → `202`. |
| POST | `/api/webhooks/logto` | Signature-verified | (Optional) user/role sync events from Logto. |

---

## Internal worker endpoints (NOT public; called by cron/queue only)

| Trigger | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Calendar scan (cron) | Graph scan → match → dedup → upsert meetings |
| Bot dispatch (cron) | Dispatch Recall bot ≤5 min before start |
| Transcript watchdog | 90-min window → else `needs_attention` + Resend alert |
| Pipeline job | Ingest → generate 6 docs → extract tasks → store → notify |
| Daily sync (cron) | 5:45 gather → 6:00 generate + Resend |
| Pre-meeting brief (cron) | Generate brief at lead time |

n8n calls **public backend API endpoints** above (never the DB/R2 directly, D13).

---

## Middleware contract (applied to every `/api` route)

```ts
// illustrative
const { userId, role } = verifyLogtoJWT(req);          // 401 if missing/invalid
if (route.requireAdmin && role !== 'admin') return 403;
if (route.requireEditor && !['admin','standard'].includes(role)) return 403;
req.user = { userId, role };
// handler then does resource-level checks (folder visibility, task ownership)
// and relies on Supabase RLS as defense-in-depth.
```
